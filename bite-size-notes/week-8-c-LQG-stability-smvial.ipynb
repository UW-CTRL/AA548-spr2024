    "### Introduction\n",
    "At the beginning of week eight, we finally had all of the pieces in place for a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) system.  An LQG system combines a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control scheme with a Kallman filter state estimator. We had proven that for a system with linear dynamics and a quadratic cost function an LQR provided optimum controls to minimize the quadratic cost.  Likewise we had shown that a Kallman filter was an optimum state estimator (minimizing uncertainty) for these systems. Via the Separation Prinicipal we showed that LQR and Kallman filters maintained their optimality when combined. We had even learned how to approximate linear dynamics and quadratic cost functions for systems without them so that they might get in on this good thing we have going. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed much of the quarter was spent assembling, piece by piece, the tools necessary to implement LQG systems. Where do you go from this lofty perch of optimality?  Consider the question, \"With respect to what is LQG an optimal control/estimation framework?\"  Or more to the point, \"In what ways are LQG schemes not optimal?\" One answer came in a famously terse article published in 1978 by John Doyle [1]. Doyle titled his article, *Guaranteed Margins for LQG Regulators*. The abstract reads simply: \"There are none.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes will examine Doyle's findings, discuss what they say about the stability of LQG systems, and see why they offer a natural transition from state space controls to the frequency domain and the field of robust control theory. \n"
