# Introduction: 
LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) is an optimal solution for full-state feedback control, aiming to minimize a cost function chosen by the designer, typically reducing state error and control effort. Let's break down this sentence to understand what LQR is
## What is a fullstate feedback control.
We want to stabilize a system and drive all states to 0. A standard full-state feedback control can achieve this goal. (A standard full-state feedback means the system doesn't have a reference input. Other variations, such as systems with reference inputs or error tracking, are out of scope.) \
A standar full feedback controle has the block diagram. 
![fullfeedback](https://github.com/p8410077/AA548-spr2024/assets/11802603/7689c9d1-d507-4122-9feb-eb2966d2ae05)

By using the full state control, we can use the method called pole placement, literally, we are putting the poles of the system at the desired location to change the dynamics of the system. The theory of pole placement is explained in the next topic. 

## what is pole placement ?
The open loop state space representices of the system is:

$$
	\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)+ Bu(t) \\
$$

$$
	y(t) = Cx(t) +Du(t) \
$$

By finding the location of the poles of matrix A, we can understand if the system is stable. We can design a controller that stabilize the system, if the system is unstable, or drive the system to converge faster, if the system is stable. 

By implementing the full state feed back, the closed loop state space representices of the system is:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)+ Bu(t) \\
$$

$$
y(t) = Cx(t) +Du(t) \\
$$

$$
u(t) = -Kx(t)
$$

By sustituting u(t) with -Kx(t), the closed loop state space representices of the system is:

$$ 
\dot{x}(t) = (A-BK)x(t) \\
$$

$$
y(t) = (C-DK)x(t)
$$

We know that the eigenvalue of the matrix (A-BK) is the poles of the system. We can using K matrix to put the poles at desired location and therefore change the respose of the system. 


## How to chose K ?  
Since we can change the response of the system by pole placement, we might ask ourselves where should we put the poles, in other words, how to choose K? We can choose K that satisfies design criteria such as settling time. Another idea is to construct the problem into an optimization framework that minimizes the state error and control effort, named LQR.

In class, we already disccused, by using HJB, the optimal control input u^* is a function of A,B,R,Q,P where

$$
\begin{aligned}
	A \text{ is the A matrix of the system (know)};\\
	B \text{ is the B matrix of the system (know)};\\
	Q \text{ is a states weighing function (know)};\\
	R \text{ is a control weighing function  (know)};\\
	P \text{ is a matrix variable form the Riccati equation (Uknow)};
 \end{aligned}
$$

And by solving the Riccati equation, equivalently finding the P matrix, we can find the optimal control input $u^*$
The variation of the optimal representies of LQR and correponding Riccati equation and control u are summirized below.

Fron this point, we narrow down the optimal problem to solving a differentail matrix equation or an algebratic equation, correspongding to either continuous time or discret time Ricatti equaiton. And I want to show how to solving the continuous time Ricatti equation (a differentail matrix equation) for the continuous finite time optimal problem using matlab ode45. 
 
# Main body 
## Solving the Recatti equation using matlab ode45 (Method from AA550 Nonlinear optimal control by Prof. Santosh Divasia)

Please refer to the attached code. The following content is an explanation of the code.

The continuous finite time optimal control problem in terns on LQR is:

$$
	\min \int_{0}^{T}x(t)^T Q(t) x(t) + u(t)^T R(t) u(t) + x(T)^T Q(T) x(T) 
$$

$$
	\text{s.t  } \dot{x} = Ax + Bu
$$

The Riccati equtaion is :

$$
0 =  \dot{P} (t) + (P(t)A+A^TP(t)+Q-P(t)BR^{-1}B^TP(t)) 
$$

$$
\dot{P} (t) =  -P(t)A-A^TP(t)-Q-P(t)BR^{-1}B^TP(t)
$$

Optimal control input is :

$$u^*(t) =-R^{-1}B^TP(t)x$$

By applying boundery condition to Riccati equation, P matrix at final time,  $P(tf)$, is $Q(T)$ is our final condition.
However, to solve PDE, we need to specify the initial condition rather than final condition. 
We can still sovle $\dot{P}$ for P for, by solving the differential equation backward in time with initial condition $P(0) = Q(T)$.

The command in matlab is: 

[t,PV]=ode45(@(t,p) dpp(t,p,A,B,Q,R,E,F),[0 (tf-ti)],Ptf,options);


The first step is rewrite the Riccati equation as in reversive form: 

$$\dot{P}(t) =  P(t)A+A^TP(t)+Q-P(t)BR^{-1}B^TP(t)$$

To define a function named "dpp" as the reversed Riccati equation, which will be a anonymous function passing to ode45. 

Since the inpout of the ode45 is a vactor, We need to reshape the vector to the original P matrix in the dpp founciton and reshape the output, $\dot{P}$ as a vector. 

After solving the P, we will have Pm*Pm-by-n matrix. Pm is the dimention of the state or the dimention of the P matrix, n is the time stes number solving by ode45. 

Because the solution is backward in time, we need to reverse the oder by using the matlab function fliup(). to reorder the PV vector and the corresponding time step in time. 

Finally, we compute the optimal control u^*(t), at the time t = tm, by extracting the PV vector in corresponding row at tm into the original matrix P(tm) and plug it into the equation

$u^*(tm) = R^{-1}BP(tm)$

from t = 0 to t = final. The result is the series of the optimal control $u^*$. 


Let's do a example:
The optimal control problem in terns on LQR is:

 $$
	\min \int_{0}^{1}x(t)^T Q(t) x(t) + u(t)^T R(t) u(t) + x(T)^T Q(T) x(T)
$$
 $$
	s.t \dot{x} = Ax + Bu
 $$

Where

$$
A =  \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  \\\ 3 & 0 \end{bmatrix} 
B =  \begin{bmatrix} 0  \\\ 3  \end{bmatrix} 
Q =  \begin{bmatrix} 0  \\\ 3  \end{bmatrix} 
R= 1
$$

$$
Q(T) = \begin{bmatrix} 50 & 0  \\\ 0 & 50  \end{bmatrix} \\
x = \begin{bmatrix} x1  \\\ x2 \end{bmatrix} \\
$$

$$
\text{u is one dimention.} \\
$$

$$
\text{initial state} x(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 1  \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
$$

# Conclusion: 
1. We succesfully use ode45 to solve Ricatti equation and find the optimal control for continuous finite time problem.
2. For discrete time LQR need different technic to solve, for example: the infinit time problen is not a ODE, therefore can't use ode45.
